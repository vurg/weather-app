# Weather App

## Getting Started

This is a weather app I developed for Android devices. It uses geolocation and the OpenWeatherMap api. Users can obtain the current weather, as well as the next 5-days forecast, for their location.

Use `flutter run` to fetch all the dependencies. Works best on Pixel 6 API 33.
